== Multboot under FEL ==
=== Introduction ===
This version works using only under FEL. uboot and other files are not installed on the boot media. Hence requries to be booted in FEL mode. ( connect FEL -> GND ) Once the board is swithed on, connect minicom/kermit to /dev/ttyACM0 or so on Linux host computer. Then run upload.sh to upload and boot kernel, initrd, from another terminal window. This limitation is due to unavailability of u-boot with nand flash support ( atleast ubifs one ). With a suitable version of u-boot, 
you can burn the boot files onto NAND flash ( mtd device ), and use the setup in
stand alone mode. But until a suitable u-boot is available, only option seems like FEL. 

All these kernel, tools etc where cross compiled, using gcc-linaro-5.3.1-2016.05-x86_64_arm-linux-gnueabihf

=== Note ===
	This version works only via serial console. connect a usb->uart to
tx,rx gnd pins (eg: pl2303 serial port ). All installation must be done
through minicom/kermit. Once the installer boots, proceed to normal installation
of slackware. Choose to install to usb pendrive. ( copy installation files to
pendrive and choose installation source from there ).

=== debian.8.3.chip on /dev/sda1 ===
First boot into chip the usual way, booting debian 8.3 ( assume )
Then connect a flash drive to usb, and make a copy of the / ( excluding proc, dev etc )
sudo su
test -d /flash  || mkdir /fash
mount /dev/sda1 /flash
(cd /; tar cfz - * ) | (cd /flash; tar xfz - )
cd /flash
mv dev dev.org/
mv proc proc.org/
mv run run.org/
mv sys sys.org/
mkdir dev proc run sys
sync
umount /flash

now boot into new /dev/sda1 copy in debian.8.3.chip  as follows:
power down C.H.I.P.
connect FEL -> GND
connect a usb-serial like pl2303 dongle to PC USB,
make a copy of files in github://gv1/chip/multiboot multiboot
in one terminal, run:
	minicom -D /dev/ttyUSB0
cd multiboot
turn on CHIP
sh ./upload.sh
	and wait for board to boot into debian.

=== Slackware 14.2 installer under FEL ===
see copy from github: slackware.installer, and do a similar procedure
 for how to get into slackware installer again in minicom -D /dev/ttyUSB0.
If the slackware sources are in flash /slackwaearm-14.2, proceed with
that as source for installation.

=== Copying debian.8.3 to USB storage in sub directory for multiboot ===
files in /flash/debian.8.3.chip after copying files in /:
bin/   dev.org/  lib/    opt/       root/     sbin/  sys.org/  var/
boot/  etc/      media/  proc/      run/      srv/   tmp/
dev/   flash/    mnt/    proc.org/  run.org/  sys/   usr/


TODO see slackware directory to see how to boot into slackware.
